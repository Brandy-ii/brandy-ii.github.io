        <div id="solid-boxed">
          <p>
            <b>Greetings from my corner of the cyberspace!</b> I'm an experienced Full-Stack Developer specializing in TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and cloud computing. Automating workflows to make life simpler is my jam, and cybersecurity is more than just a buzzword for meᅳit's a calling. With a strong background in security architecture and a proficiency in Agile development frameworks like Scrum, my goal is to craft scalable and secure digital ecosystems.
            <br>
            Beyond the lines of code, I have a long time love for nerd culture and digital art. In my free time, you'll find me immersed in the worlds of Science Fiction & Fantasy, engaging their online communities, and doodling my favorite characters. Above all, I aspire to be someone who is kind in both my personal and professional life, and I believe in promoting love and optimism.
